PHPX modules are explicit. Nothing is globally available unless imported.

## Export and import

`utils/name.phpx`:

```phpx
export function formatName($raw: string): string {
  return trim($raw)
}
```

`main.phpx`:

```phpx
import { formatName } from "@/utils/name"
echo formatName("  Sami  ")
```

Expected output:

```text
Sami
```

## Why this model

- dependency graph is explicit
- unused imports can be reported
- refactors are safer across large codebases

## Path behavior

- `@/` resolves from project root
- importing a folder resolves `index.phpx` where applicable
- component folders and route folders are independent concerns

## CLI modules with `bin`

PHPX modules can expose executable commands with `deka.json` `bin` entries.

`php_modules/adwa/ls/deka.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "adwa-ls",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "main.phpx",
  "bin": {
    "ls": "main.phpx"
  }
}
```

This lets the runtime resolve `ls` from module metadata instead of hardcoded command maps.

## Shebang scripts

PHPX files can be executed as scripts with deka shebangs:

```phpx
#!/usr/bin/deka
---
$title = "Hello script"
---
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>{$title}</body>
</html>
```

Supported forms:

- `#!/usr/bin/deka`
- `#!/usr/bin/env deka`
