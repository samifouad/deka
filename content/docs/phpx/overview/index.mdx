PHPX is a typed, module-oriented language that runs on the Deka PHP runtime.
It is designed for developers with PHP experience who want stronger types, cleaner module boundaries, and modern component workflows.

## What stays familiar from PHP

- `$` variables
- familiar scalar and array values
- request/response runtime model
- no mandatory build step for serving apps

## What changes in PHPX

- strict typing by default
- explicit imports/exports (non-global modules)
- interfaces + structs for data modeling
- JSX/component support for rendering
- `Option`/`Result` style error handling instead of exceptions
