    # deka setup

Run the interactive setup before your first deployment. It writes configuration and prepares your registry auth.

```bash
deka setup
```

## What it configures

- Container registry access
- Runtime service defaults
- Deployment preferences and storage paths

Config is stored under `~/.config/deka/` so you can re-run setup safely when you need to rotate credentials.

If registry authentication fails, you can also run:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io
```
