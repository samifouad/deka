This guide gets you up and running with Tana as a **user**. You'll create an account, check your balance, and make your first transfer.

## Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @tananetwork/tana
```

Verify installation:

```bash
tana --version
```

## Create Your Account

Create a local user account:

```bash
tana new user alice --name "Alice"
```

This generates:
- A unique username
- An Ed25519 keypair for signing transactions
- Config stored in `~/.config/tana/users/`

## Connect to a Network

To use Tana, you need access to a running network.

### Local Development

For testing locally (requires Docker):

```bash
# Start local infrastructure
docker compose up -d

# Verify services are running
tana test
```

### Remote Network

If connecting to an existing network, configure the endpoint:

```bash
tana config set ledger-url https://api.example-network.com
```

## Deploy Your Account

Register your account on the blockchain:

```bash
tana deploy user alice
```

This creates a transaction that adds your public key to the network.

## Check Your Balance

See your current balances:

```bash
tana balance alice
```

Output:
```
Balances for alice:

  USD    0.00

Total currencies: 1
```

> **Note:** New accounts start with zero balance. A sovereign or other user must send you funds first.

## Send Funds

Once you have a balance, send funds to others:

```bash
tana transfer alice bob 50 USD
```

You'll see:
```
Transferring 50 USD from alice to bob...

✓ Balance verified
✓ Transaction signed
✓ Transaction submitted
✓ Transfer complete

Transaction ID: tx_abc123
```

## System Health

Verify the network is working:

```bash
tana test
```

This checks database connectivity, service availability, and block production.
