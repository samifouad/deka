PHPX is a typed language on the Deka runtime for teams that want PHP familiarity with stronger boundaries.

## Core shifts from PHP

- explicit imports/exports instead of implicit globals
- interfaces + structs for modeling data
- `Option` and `Result` patterns for explicit error/absence handling
- JSX/component rendering with optional hydration

## Runtime architecture

- Deka runtime is implemented in Rust.
- Code execution is isolated with a layered sandbox model using WebAssembly and V8.
- The PHPX and PHP standard library surface is authored in PHPX modules.
- Traditional PHP "extensions" are modeled as modules under `php_modules/` instead of native extension binaries.
- PHPX can import user modules compiled to Wasm (`import ... as wasm`) with a WIT-based ABI contract for cross-language modules.

## Quick example

```phpx
interface GreetingProps {
  $name: string
}

function Greeting({ $name }: GreetingProps): string {
  return "Hello, " . $name
}

echo Greeting({ name: "Sami" })
```

Expected output:

```text
Hello, Sami
```
