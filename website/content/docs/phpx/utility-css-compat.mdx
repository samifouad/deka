If you already know Tailwind, the mental model is simple:
you keep writing utility classes in markup, and Deka generates the CSS at runtime.

## Zero-config developer experience

Utility CSS in PHPX is designed to be effectively zero configuration:

- no Tailwind config setup to get started
- no plugin/version choreography just to style a page
- no CSS build pipeline to wire into your app lifecycle

For day-to-day development this means:

- write classes directly in PHPX/HTML
- run the app
- get styles immediately

There is no separate CSS build step and no generated artifact files you need to track manually.

## Runtime performance model

Generating utility CSS on the fly does not imply a large runtime penalty in normal use.

- class extraction happens from server-rendered output
- generated CSS is cached
- repeat requests reuse cached output

In practice this feels similar to importing Tailwind in a buildless setup, but without adding a separate CSS toolchain.
With caching enabled, this approach is designed to be fast enough for production workloads.

## Quick start

Create `deka.css.json` in project root:

```json
{
  "utility": {
    "enabled": true,
    "preflight": false
  }
}
```

Then write classes directly in your PHPX/HTML output.

```phpx
---
function Hero() {
  return <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto p-8">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-wide">Linkhash</h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-400">Publish PHPX modules with confidence.</p>
    <button class="mt-6 px-4 py-2 rounded bg-zinc-900 text-white hover:bg-zinc-800">
      Get started
    </button>
  </section>
}
---
<Hero />
```

## What to expect if you are used to Tailwind

- class names are Tailwind-style
- variants like `hover:` and responsive prefixes work
- unknown classes are ignored (no hard runtime error)
- coverage is growing; not full Tailwind parity yet

## Supported variants

- `hover:`
- `focus:`
- `active:`
- `dark:`
- `sm:`
- `md:`
- `lg:`
- `xl:`

## Common class groups available now

- layout/display: `block`, `inline-block`, `flex`, `grid`, `hidden`
- alignment/grid: `items-*`, `justify-*`, `flex-wrap`, `grid-cols-*`, `gap-*`
- sizing: `w-full`, `h-full`, `min-h-screen`, `max-w-6xl`
- spacing: `p-*`, `px-*`, `py-*`, `pt-*`, `mt-*`, `mb-*`, `mx-auto`
- typography: `uppercase`, `font-semibold`, `font-bold`, `font-mono`, `text-*`, `tracking-wide`
- borders/surface: `rounded*`, `shadow-*`, `border`, `border-b`
- misc: `whitespace-pre-wrap`, `transition-shadow`
- color families: selected `bg-*`, `text-*`, `border-*`

## Example: card grid

```html
<div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-6">
  <article class="rounded border border-zinc-800 p-4 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h2 class="font-semibold text-zinc-100">component/core</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-zinc-400">VNode and JSX runtime.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="rounded border border-zinc-800 p-4 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
    <h2 class="font-semibold text-zinc-100">db/postgres</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-zinc-400">Postgres module for PHPX.</p>
  </article>
</div>
```

## Current limits

- no full Tailwind plugin ecosystem
- no full `tailwind.config` parity yet
- arbitrary value support is partial

## Runtime behavior

- CSS is generated from server-rendered class usage and injected into `<head>` as `#__deka_utility_css`
- generated CSS is cached in `.cache/utility-css/`
- unknown classes are ignored to keep migration smooth

## Vanilla CSS is still supported

Utility classes are optional.
You can still use normal CSS in components and pages:

```phpx
<style>
  .hero-title { letter-spacing: 0.08em; }
</style>

<h1 class="hero-title">Linkhash</h1>
```
