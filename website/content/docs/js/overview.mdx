This is the entry point for the Deka PHPX runtime docs.
Use it to orient where to find handlers, runtime config, modules, and the PHPX language syntax.

PHPX is a modern typed language that compiles to PHP, providing:
- Type safety with compile-time checking
- Modern syntax with pattern matching and error handling
- JSX-like components for web development
- Seamless interop with existing PHP code
- Module system with imports/exports

Start with the language guide to learn PHPX syntax, then explore the standard library and runtime features.
