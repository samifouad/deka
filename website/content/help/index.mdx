## What is Tana?

Tana is a blockchain platform designed to be **user-owned and operated**. Anyone can start their own blockchain or join existing networks as a validator node. Smart contracts are written in familiar **TypeScript** and executed in a sandboxed V8 environment.

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="TypeScript Contracts" icon="seti:typescript">
    Write smart contracts in TypeScript - no new language to learn. Full type safety and familiar tooling.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Multi-Currency Support" icon="puzzle">
    No native token required. Create and manage any currency directly in your contracts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="CLI-First Design" icon="laptop">
    Everything controllable from the terminal. Deploy, manage, and monitor your blockchain from the command line.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Decentralized Nodes" icon="setting">
    Start your own chain or join existing networks. Full validator node capabilities.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { console } from 'tana:core'
import { kv } from 'tana:kv'

// Simple counter contract
const current = await kv.get('counter')
const count = current ? parseInt(current) : 0

await kv.put('counter', String(count + 1))

console.log('Counter:', count + 1)
```

## Architecture Overview

Tana consists of **five compiled binaries**:

- **`tana`** - Main CLI for managing chains, users, and contracts
- **`tana-runtime`** - Rust V8 engine for on-chain contract execution
- **`tana-edge`** - HTTP server for off-chain contract APIs
- **`tana-mesh`** - Network coordinator for validator discovery
- **`tana-t4`** - Content-addressable storage service

All orchestrated through the CLI:

```bash
# Install Tana
npm install -g @tananetwork/tana

# Create a blockchain
tana new chain local

# Deploy a smart contract
tana deploy contract ./contract.ts
```

**Status:** Testnet ready - Multi-validator consensus operational

Built with Rust (deno_core), TypeScript, Bun, PostgreSQL, and Redis.
